# Ketura's rulings

What Ketura has said about how the game is to be read and how the campaign is to be run, as she said it. This is
the first thing an expectation may rest on, ahead of the Comprehensive Rules and the card's text. Add to it
whenever she answers a question; do not paraphrase an answer into something broader than what she said.

Each entry: the date, what was asked or what it was about, what she said, and which cards it bears on.

## How the campaign is run

**2026-10-04. Gaps in what a test can do.** They are added to the test rig, never hidden in one card's suite as
ad hoc test functions.

**2026-10-04. Candidate bugs.** Park them for her to rule on rather than fixing them. "Most HJSON bugs have
historically been correctly identified by you, but sometimes you take a correct implementation with an obscure
ruling as an incorrect implementation." Once it is clear how often that happens she will have them fixed without
parking.

**2026-10-04. Questions.** Ask whenever there is one; do not guess at niche rulings or historical minutiae.

**2026-10-04. Earlier iterations of PC cards.** Every iteration of a PC card is kept, with a view to a future mode
that shows how a card used to be handled. Their tests are kept in step with the live ones but stay switched off
until that mode exists.

## Formats

**2026-10-04. Formats and correctness.** Formats are by and large a table-validation concept: players may not
show up at a table with a deck that violates the format, but with a few exceptions format has very little effect
on whether play is correct. "A card from set 1 doesn't care that the site path has cards from set 18 in it by and
large." Tests need not hold a card to the format it was printed for.

**2026-10-04. The exceptions.** A card that explicitly mentions sites of a certain block has to be tested on that
block. And rules that differ by format have to be tested in a format-aware way where a card touches them. Her
example: the rule that the Ring-bearer's skirmish cannot be cancelled was introduced in the King era, so
Fellowship- and Towers-era formats do not have it, and cards that cancel a Ring-bearer's skirmish need tests under
both sets of rules. She expects the list of such rules to be short.

## What gets tested

**2026-10-04. Isolation and interactions.** Cards are by and large tested in isolation. But wherever a ruling's
explanation uses a pair of cards interacting as its example, there should be a test that the interaction goes as
the ruling says.

**2026-10-04. Mechanic tests.** A set of tests that a particular card happened to uncover, but which is not
*because* of that card, may deserve to be tests of the mechanic itself, agnostic of any card, in their own folder
structure as a sibling to the card tests.

**2026-10-04. The old `at` tests.** They were written before the rig (or occasionally stubbornly after it) and are
to be converted: to rig tests in the appropriate card's file, as some already have been, or to card-agnostic
feature or mechanic tests.

## Sources

**2026-10-04. Comprehensive Rules 4.2** should contain all the official rulings.

**2026-10-04. The reviewed spreadsheet** (`gen_en_standard.tsv`) is the combination of at least two card
databases and has been combed for errors since. It is what the card images are regenerated from, and it was the
input from which the Decipher definitions and their stat tests were first generated.
